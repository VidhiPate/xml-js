### Brief Description 
- I generated the Json file with the help of the Mockaroo. 
- Then created the HTML page and along with the HTML page page I linked the stu.js 
- In which I map my json data into a table and create functionality to perform my three distinct characteristics, as shown below.
   - Filter by any field
   - Filter by using the radio button
   - Filter by Language

### Logic 
- The getAllStudents function takes many parameters and filters the data accordingly. The getStudentById function takes an Id parameter and returns the student with that Id.

### Framework
- The student folder is located in the api folder
- The functions that implement the login is in the student file 
- the data folder contains the data file i.e., the JSON file created with the help of Mockaroo site
- The main.js file is in charge of loading data
- The stu.js file is in the html folder, and it bundles everything together because the browser can only read html
- The index.html file is in the html folder and the html site is created in that file and stu.js is linked with that file
- Package files are created
